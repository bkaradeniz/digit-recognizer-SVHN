# digit-recognizer-SVHN
Statistical Learning term project.

In this project two different neural networks are evaluated for an image classification task, for both of the networks same image pre-processing technique and the same data pipelining is used. 

The task requires to build a neural network classifier using Street View House Numbers (SVHN) dataset.
